About time I started to blog, mostly to force myself to learn things and write about what I learn.  [Jekyll] seems pretty intuitive so far.

I wonder how tags work.  I'm reading about canoeing right now, so I'm tagging this blog post with canoeing.  But I don't know how to link to it yet.

I'm reading [Canoe Racing] right now, its getting me pumped to learn how to make boats go fast.
