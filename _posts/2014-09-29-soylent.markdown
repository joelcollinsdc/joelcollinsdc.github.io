I finally got my 1 week supply of soylent from kickstarter last week.  I think the biggest advantage for me is the relative ease of tracking macros that is afforded if you replace an entire meal with soylent.  Unfortunatly the default soylent mixture is already too carb-heavy for my goals.

My current daily targets are 145g protein / 75g fat / 200g carbs.  Soylent, assuming normal ration sizes, is 114g protein / 57g fat / 252g carbs.  Soylent has a [diy site](http://diy.soylent.me) that you can use to customize the mixture which looks interesting... 

As far as taste goes...  Its definitely not something to switch to just for the flavor.  I'd rate it 3 or 4 out of 10.  It basically tastes exactly what you would imagine an flavorless meal replacement to taste like.
