I've been travelling for just over a month now, having briefly visited Thailand, Vietnam, and Taiwan before speding a bit more time in the south island of New Zealand.  There are few vacationers and more long term travellers here, probably because its low season for tourists right now.  I've noticed the people I've met can mostly be grouped into the following 3 categories:

* People on a 12 month working holiday visa (85%)
* People who left their job and are taking time before finding a new one (15%)
* Travelling retirees (only met one so far)

Most travellers are here on a working holiday visa, which allows them a 12 month stay, and they are here for the full 12 months.  These are usually younger, either straight out of school or college.  They work for a few months and travel the rest of the time.  Most of the travel I've witnessed has seemed to be a little less inspired than I thought would be the normal... for instance getting out of bed before 8 is unusual, and often seem to be lounging around the hostel.  I suppose travel for 12 months is done at a slower pace though.

The other category is people who have left their jobs in search of something different.  I've met a few programmers like me, but I've also met some working in finance or other profitable fields where people in their 30's have the luxury to take some time off after saving a bit.  They are often in search of more adventure and purpose than the working holiday travellers... although I'm still not convinced that there is a way to active this through travel.

Finally I met one inspirational woman who was living the backpacker lifestyle on her UK pension and rental income.  It's been suprising the range of people that are comfortable staying in dorm rooms in hostels in NZ... but they are often quite nice hostels.

Also... I signed up to [Iron Blogger DC](https://notes.pault.ag/planet/) so hopefully this weekly blogging thing will encourage me to be more active.  I'm hoping that I get more consistent on posting about Civic Tech topics in particular.
