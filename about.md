I'm a developer in the Washington DC area.  At work most of my time and effort is spent trying to force Drupal to do things it wasn't designed to do.  Outside of work I tinker with various projects to help the various paddling teams I belong to.

My github is pretty empty right now, as drupal.org is the home of a lot of my work, but I intend to change that.

In my spare time, I am a member of [DCDBC](http://dcdragonboat.org) and [NCAWPA](http://ncawpa.org) and spent a big portion of my free time on the Anacostia or Potomac rivers.  I'm facinated by the sport of canoe paddling and am eager to try marathon next year.
