Most warm weekends you can find me on the water, either with [NCA Outrigger](http://www.ncawpa.org/nca-outrigger.html) or [DC Dragon Boat Club](http://dcdragonboat.org/).  In 2015 I had the privilege to represent the US team at the IDBF World Championships.


### [DC Dragon Boat Club](http://dcdragonboat.org/)

Practices on the [Washington Channel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Washington+Channel,+Washington,+DC/@38.8691035,-77.0413514,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89b7b7729dffce8f:0x46d4d7a5b5f60b1)

A recreational and competitive dragon boat club.  Home to the Dead Presidents who have been regionally competitive the past few years.
